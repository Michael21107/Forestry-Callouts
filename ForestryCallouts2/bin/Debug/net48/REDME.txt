Notes:

- If you are only playing with Forestry Callouts installed please set the distance checker to false in the ini file. If you do 
not it will result in a crash.

- Water Callouts are in Forestry Callouts 2 but purposely disabled. You may see water related callouts in Callout Interface Menu like 
"BoatPursuit". They won't start.
