Install Instructions

- Drag and Drop "ForestryCallouts2.dll", "ForestryCallouts2.ini", and "ForestryCallouts2" folder to your GTA5\Plugins\LSPDFR. You may then from there configure settings in the INI file if you wish to do so.

Notes:

- Water Callouts are in Forestry Callouts 2 but purposely disabled. You may see water related callouts in CalloutInterface Menu like "BoatPursuit". They won't start.
