Foretry Callouts v1.1
	*Misc
		- Added Screenshots
			@ Thanks to Pawpi and xXManATeeXx
		- Changed the cover pic!
	*VehicleOnFire
		- Added feature where the searcharea for the suspect wont spawn unitll later into extinguishing the car fire.
		- Fixed a bug where only one callout position was working and being used, there is a total of 10 spawnpoints.
		- Fixed a issue with some of the spawnpoints where the suspect would walk off cliffs and stuff he shouldnt.
		- Rewrote some stuff so the suspect spawns later in the callout, hopefully preventing the suspect from doing
			dumb things.
	*Added Callout: Miising Hiker
		- 7 Spawnpoints currently, will add more.
		
Foretry Callouts v1.2
	*Ini
		- Changed the callout options to make more sense (To disable set to false to enable set to true)
		- Added option to disable the message in the top left after every callout that says "Press 'END' at anytime to 
		end the callout". !!-YOU WILL STILL HAVE TO PRESS END TO FULLY RELEASE VEHICLES, PEDS, ETC FROM THE CALLOUTS-!!
		I added this option cause it seemed quite annoying watching youtube vids and seeing that constantly in the top left
	*Logger Pursuit
		- Fixed some spawn issues where the suspect would just get stuck and leave the vehicle right away or just be stupid.
		- Added chance for a passenger
		- Made it so the LoggerTruck will delete when callout ends there's really no other way to get rid of it as you cant
		tow it. Ive made this optional in the ini if you dont want it to delete on end callout set option to false. If option
		is set to false the truck will be dismissed instead of deleted and eventually despawned by gta5 it self.
